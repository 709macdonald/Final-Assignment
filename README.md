# Final-Assignment

I still need to centre my three last paragraphs. I can't figure out how to edit them seperate from the first paragrahp. I've tried using <p.namex> and also <p id=namex> but that won't help distinguish between them. I have all my editing code in the style tag which I believe is in the head tag.
